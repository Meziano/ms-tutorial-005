# Microservices Tutorial 005
## Introducing Feign

[Feign](https://github.com/Netflix/feign) is a declarative web service client, that makes writing web service clients easier.
In this tutorial we will use `Feign` for the communication between our **department-service** and **employee-service**.

It's important to understand that `Feign` can be used independently from other `Spring Cloud Components`.
We will use our 3 services **department-service**, **employee-service** and  **config-service** from [lat tutorial](https://github.com/Meziano/ms-tutorial-004).
